This repository contains solutions I've written for problems on the [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info) website. Rosalind is a sweet bioinformatics trainer that you should check out! I'm using it both to learn Python and brush up on my biology.

Please note that these solutions are not optimized and in most cases aren't robust. Run each script using

<code>python filename.py</code>

Then provide a path to a file containing the necessary parameters for the script.

## Example Problems &amp; Files
Visit [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info) to download example data sets for these problems, or to try them out on your own.

## Python Scripts
*expected_offspring_dominant_phenotype.py:* calculates the expected number of offspring with the dominant phenotype given the genotypic frequencies of all couples as six space-separated numbers in a file. [(problem at Rosalind)](http://rosalind.info/problems/iev/)

*hamming_distance.py:* calculates the number of differences between two DNA sequences of equal length, given on lines 1 and 2 of a text file. [(problem at Rosalind)](http://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/)

*mendels_first_law.py:* calculates the probability of observation of the dominant phenotype given the populations of homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous recessive individuals as "*k* *m* *n*" in a file. [(problem at Rosalind)](http://rosalind.info/problems/iprb/)
