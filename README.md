This repository contains solutions I've written for problems on the [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info) website. Rosalind is a sweet bioinformatics trainer that you should check out! I'm using it both to learn Python and brush up on my biology.

Please note that these solutions are not optimized and in most cases aren't robust. Run each script using

<code>python filename.py</code>

Then provide a path to a file containing the necessary parameters for the script.

## Example Problems &amp; Files
Visit [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info) to download example data sets for these problems, or to try them out on your own.
